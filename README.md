## Inspiration

Cyber-security address various threats with data loses thefts, breaches and violation of privacy. Fortunately, we have a group of security experts who looks after these threats. They have developed controls and benchmark protocols to address these challenges. Often, usage of the tools requires a special effort and domain knowledge from software engineers. This library helps AWS cloud developers with controls defined by:

* [CIS: Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org)
* [GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/tag/gdpr/)

Please find details about supported controls in [the checklists](doc/checklist.md)

## Getting Started

The latest version of the library is available at `master` branch of the repository. All development, including new features and bug fixes, take place on the `master` branch using forking and pull requests as described in contribution guidelines.

```bash
npm install --save @ssh.com/c3
```

Use components provided by the library:

```typescript
import * as c3 from '@ssh.com/c3'

const stack = new cdk.Stack()
new c3.kms.SymmetricKey(stack, 'MyKey')
new c3.efs.FileSystem(stack, 'MyEFS', /* ... */)
new c3.rds.DatabaseInstance(stack, 'MyRDS', /* ... */)
```

## How To Contribute
